Getting Started with Ruby & Rails Development

* Some excellent Rails tutorial info at: http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#sec-up_and_running

* You'll need to install Ruby; for that, you should use RVM:
  curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s
  
*Then, you can run

  rvm requirements

  to install prerequisites. BE WARNED: This will potentially download and compile quite a few things, so make sure your laptop is plugged in. You may want to make a nice cup of coffee.

* Okay, time to install rails!

  rvm install 2.0.0 --with-openssl-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr
  
  This will also take a while, though maybe not as long as the requirements.
